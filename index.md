## About Me

I am a PhD candidate and researcher at the **Professorship of Distributed Information Systems** at *Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena*. My academic work combines **computer science**, **semantic technologies**, and **knowledge representation**.
My early research focused on **Natural Language Processing**, particularly named entity recognition and large language models for **legal norm analysis** and **digital public services**. More recently, my research focus has shifted toward **Knowledge Graphs**, with an emphasis on the **representation of uncertainty** in interdisciplinary contexts, including applications in **copolymer chemistry**. My goal is to develop robust semantic models that support complex decision-making across domains.
